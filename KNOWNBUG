Known bugs in libpng version 1.2.20rc5

1. February 23, 2006: The custom makefiles don't build libpng with -lz.

   STATUS: This is a subject of debate. The change will probably be made
   as a part of a major overhaul of the makefiles in libpng version 1.3.0.

2. February 24, 2006: The Makefile generated by the "configure" script
   fails to install symbolic links
   libpng12.so => libpng12.so.0.1.2.9betaN
   that are generated by the custom makefiles.
