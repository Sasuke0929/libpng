Using the ./configure script -- 16 December 2002.
=================================================


The ./configure script should work compatibly with what scripts/makefile.*
did, however there are some options you need to add to configure explicitly,
which previously was done semi-automatically (if you didn't edit
scripts/makefile.* yourself, that is)


CFLAGS="-Wall -O3 -funroll-loops \
-malign-loops=2 -malign-functions=2" ./configure --prefix=/usr/include \
--with-pkgconfigdir=/usr/lib/pkgconfig --includedir=/usr/include

You can alternatively specify --includedir=/usr/include, /usr/local/include,
/usr/include/png12, or whatever.
