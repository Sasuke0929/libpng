Using the ./configure script -- 16 December 2002.
=================================================

The ./configure script should work compatibly with what scripts/makefile.*
did, however there are some options you might need to add to configure
explicitly, which previously was done semi-automatically (if you didn't edit
scripts/makefile.* yourself, that is)

CFLAGS="-Wall -O -funroll-loops \
-malign-loops=2 -malign-functions=2" ./configure --prefix=/usr/include \
--with-pkgconfigdir=/usr/lib/pkgconfig --includedir=/usr/include

You can alternatively specify --includedir=/usr/include, /usr/local/include,
/usr/include/libpng14, or whatever.

If you find that the configure script is out-of-date or is not supporting
your platform properly, try running autogen.sh to regenerate "configure",
"Makefile.in", and the other configuration files. Then try configure again.
