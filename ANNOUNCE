Changes since the last public release (1.6.6):

Version 1.6.7beta01 [September 30, 2013]
  Revised unknown chunk code to correct several bugs in the NO_SAVE_/NO_WRITE
    combination
  Allow HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN to work when other options are configured off. Also
    fixed the pngminim makefiles to work when $(MAKEFLAGS) contains stuff
    which terminates the make options (as by default in recent versions of
    Gentoo).
  Avoid up-cast warnings in pngvalid.c. On ARM the alignment requirements of
    png_modifier are greater than that of png_store and as a consequence
    compilation of pngvalid.c results in a warning about increased alignment
    requirements because of the bare cast to (png_modifier*). The code is safe,
    because the pointer is known to point to a stack allocated png_modifier,
    but this change avoids the warning.
  Fixed default behavior of ARM_NEON_API. If the ARM NEON API option was
    compiled without the CHECK option it defaulted to on, not off.
  Check user callback behavior in pngunknown.c. Previous versions compiled
    if SAVE_UNKNOWN was not available but did nothing since the callback
    was never implemented.
  Merged pngunknown.c with 1.7 version and back ported 1.7 improvements/fixes

Version 1.6.7beta02 [October 2, 2013]
