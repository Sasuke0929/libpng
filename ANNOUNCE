Changes since the last public release (1.2.10):

version 1.2.11 [June 26, 2006]
  scripts/libpng.pc.in contained "configure" style version info and would
      not work with makefiles.
    The shared-library makefiles were linking to libpng.so.0 instead of
      libpng.so.3 compatibility as the library.
  Increased sprintf buffer from 50 to 52 chars in pngrutil.c to avoid
    buffer overflow.
  Fixed bug in example.c (png_set_palette_rgb -> png_set_palette_to_rgb)
  Prepended "#! /bin/sh" to ltmail.sh and contrib/pngminus/*.sh (Cosmin).
    Removed the accidental leftover Makefile.in~ (Cosmin).
  Avoided potential buffer overflow and optimized buffer in
    png_write_sCAL(), png_write_sCAL_s() (Cosmin).
  Removed the include directories and libraries from CFLAGS and LDFLAGS
    in scripts/makefile.gcc (Nelson A. de Oliveira, Cosmin).
  Allow zero-length IDAT chunks after the entire zlib datastream, but not
    after another intervening chunk type.
    Deleted extraneous square brackets from [config.h] in configure.ac
  Added prototypes for PNG_INCH_CONVERSIONS functions to png.h
  Revised INSTALL and autogen.sh
  Fixed typo in several makefiles (-W1 should be -Wl)
  Added one zero element to png_gamma_shift[] array in pngrtran.c to avoid
    reading out of bounds.
