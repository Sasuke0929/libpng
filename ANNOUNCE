  Reverted to original png_push_save_buffer() code.

  Removed malformed "incomplete struct declaration" of png_info from png.h

version 1.5.0beta05 [February 12, 2010]
  Removed PNG_DEPSTRUCT markup in pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h, and undid the
    linewrapping that it entailed.
  Revised comments in pngstruct.h and pnginfo.h and added pointers to
    the libpng license.
  Changed PNG_INTERNAL to PNG_EXPOSE_INTERNAL_STRUCTURES
  Removed the cbuilder5 project, which has not been updated to 1.4.0.

version 1.4.1beta12 and 1.5.0beta06 [February 14, 2010]

    Nishikawa)

version 1.5.0beta08 [February 19, 2010]
  Changed #ifdef PNG_NO_STDIO_SUPPORTED to #ifdef PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO_SUPPORTED
    wherever png_snprintf() is used to construct error and warning messages.
  Noted in scripts/makefile.mingw that it expects to be run under MSYS.
  Removed obsolete unused MMX-querying support from contrib/gregbook
  Added exported png_longjmp() function.
  Removed the AIX redefinition of jmpbuf in png.h

    and "#define PNG_NO_PEDANTIC_WARNINGS" (John Bowler).
  Created new pngdebug.h and moved debug definitions there.

version 1.5.0beta13 [March 9, 2010]
  Protect pngstruct.h, pnginfo.h, and pngdebug.h from being included twice.
  Revise the "#ifdef" blocks in png_inflate() so it will compile when neither
    PNG_USER_CHUNK_MALLOC_MAX nor PNG_SET_CHUNK_MALLOC_LIMIT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Removed unused png_measure_compressed_chunk() from pngpriv.h and libpngpf.3
