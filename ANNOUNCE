Changes since the last public release (1.2.41):

version 1.2.42beta01 [December 4, 2009]
  Removed "#define PNG_NO_ERROR_NUMBERS" that was inadvertently added
    to pngconf.h in version 1.2.41.
  Revised scripts/makefile.netbsd, makefile.openbsd, and makefile.sco
    to put png.h and pngconf.h in $prefix/include, like the other scripts,
    instead of in $prefix/include/libpng.  Also revised makefile.sco
    to put them in $prefix/include/libpng%NN% instead of in
    $prefix/include/libpng/libpng%NN%.
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from scripts/makefile.darwin

version 1.2.42beta02 [December 11, 2009]
  Removed leftover "-DPNG_CONFIGURE_LIBPNG" from contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Relocated png_do_chop() to its original position in pngrtran.c. The
    change in version 1.2.41beta08 caused transparency to be handled wrong
    in some 16-bit datastreams (Yusaku Sugai).

version 1.2.42rc01 [December 17, 2009]
  No changes.

version 1.2.42rc02 [December 22, 2009]
  Renamed libpng-pc.in back to libpng.pc.in and revised CMakeLists.txt
    (revising changes made in 1.2.41beta17 and 1.2.41rc01)

version 1.2.42rc03 [December 25, 2009]
  Marked png_memcpy_check() and png_memset_check() PNG_DEPRECATED.
  Swapped PNG_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED and PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED
    in pngset.c to be consistent with other changes in version 1.2.38.

version 1.2.42rc04 [January 1, 2010]
  Marked png_memcpy_check() and png_memset_check() PNG_DEPRECATED.
  Updated copyright year.

version 1.2.42rc05 [January 2, 2010]
  Avoid deprecated references to png_ptr-io_ptr and png_ptr->error_ptr
    in pngtest.c

version 1.0.52 and 1.2.42 [January 2, 2010]
