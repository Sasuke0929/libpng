Changes since the last public release (1.4.0):

version 1.4.1beta01 [January 6, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to remove references to Y2KINFO,
    KNOWNBUG, and libpng.la (Robert Schwebel).
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to make libpng.so.14, libpng.sl.14,
    and libpng.14.dylib links in the installed library directory.
  Revised scripts/makefile.linux to make the same files as configure,
    except for libpng.la and libpng14.la.
