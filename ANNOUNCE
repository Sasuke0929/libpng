Changes since the last public release (1.5.0):

version 1.5.1beta01 [January 8, 2011]
  Added description of png_set_crc_action() to the manual.
  Added a note in the manual that the type of the iCCP profile was changed
    from png_charpp to png_bytepp in png_get_iCCP().  This change happened
    in version 1.5.0beta36 but is not noted in the CHANGES.  Similarly,
    it was changed from png_charpp to png_const_bytepp in png_set_iCCP().
  Ensure that png_rgb_to_gray ignores palette mapped images,
  Fixed the failure to handle palette mapped images correctly.

Version 1.5.1beta02 [January 14, 2011]
  Fixed a bug in handling of interlaced images (bero at arklinux.org).
  Updated CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)

Version 1.5.1beta03 [January 14, 2011]
  Fixed typecasting of some png_debug() statements (Cosmin)

Version 1.5.1beta04 [January 16, 2011]
  Updated documentation of png_set|get_tRNS() (Thomas Klausner).
  Mentioned in the documentation that applications must #include "zlib.h"
    if they need access to anything in zlib.h, and that a number of
    macros such as png_memset() are no longer accessible by applications.
  Corrected pngvalid gamma test "sample" function to access all of the color
    samples of each pixel, instead of sampling the red channel three times.
