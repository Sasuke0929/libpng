Changes since the last public release (1.6.29):

Version 1.6.30beta01 [April 1, 2017]
  Added missing "$(CPPFLAGS)" to the compile line for c.pic.o in
    makefile.linux and makefile.solaris-x86 (Cosmin).
  Revised documentation of png_get_error_ptr() in the libpng manual.
  Silence clang -Wcomma and const drop warnings (Viktor Szakats).
  Update Sourceforge URLs in documentation (https instead of http).

Version 1.6.30beta02 [April 22, 2017]
  Document need to check for integer overflow when allocating a pixel
    buffer for multiple rows in contrib/gregbook, contrib/pngminus,
    example.c, and in the manual (suggested by Jaeseung Choi). This
    is similar to the bug reported against pngquant in CVE-2016-5735.
  Removed reference to the obsolete PNG_SAFE_LIMITS macro in the documentation.

Version 1.6.30beta03 [May 22, 2017]
  Check for integer overflow in contrib/visupng and contrib/tools/genpng.
  Do not double evaluate CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR in CMakeLists.txt.
  Test CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 instead of WIN32 in CMakeLists.txt.
  Fix some URL in documentation.

Version 1.6.30beta04 [June 7, 2017]
  Avoid writing an empty IDAT when the last IDAT exactly fills the
    compression buffer (bug report by Brian Baird). This bug was
    introduced in libpng-1.6.0.

Version 1.6.30rc01 [June 14, 2017]
  No changes.

Version 1.6.30rc02 [June 25, 2017]
  Update copyright year in pnglibconf.h, make ltmain.sh executable.
  Add a reference to the libpng.download site in README.

Version 1.6.30 [June 28, 2017]
  No changes.

Version 1.6.31beta01 [July 5, 2017]
  Guard the definition of _POSIX_SOURCE in pngpriv.h (AIX already defines it;
    bug report by Michael Felt).
  Revised pngpriv.h to work around failure to compile arm/filter_neon.S
    ("typedef" directive is unrecognized by the assembler). The problem
    was introduced in libpng-1.6.30beta01.
  Added "Requires: zlib" to libpng.pc.in (Pieter Neerincx).
  Added special case for FreeBSD in arm/filter_neon.S (Maya Rashish).

Version 1.6.31beta02 [July 8, 2017]
  Added instructions for disabling hardware optimizations in INSTALL.
  Added "--enable-hardware-optimizations" configuration flag to enable
    or disable all hardware optimizations with one flag.

Version 1.6.31beta03 [July 9, 2017]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt to add INTEL_SSE and MIPS_MSA platforms.
  Changed "int" to "png_size_t" in intel/filter_sse2.c to prevent
    possible integer overflow (Bug report by John Bowler).
  Quieted "declaration after statement" warnings in intel/filter_sse2.c.
  Added scripts/makefile-linux-opt, which has hardware optimizations enabled.
