Libpng 1.2.2beta2 - February 24, 2002

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.1):

version 1.2.2beta1 [February 22, 2002]
  Fixed a bug with reading the length of iCCP profiles (Larry Reeves).
  Revised makefile.linux, makefile.gcmmx, and makefile.sgi to generate
    libpng.a, libpng12.so (not libpng.so.3), and libpng12/png.h
  Revised makefile.darwin to remove "-undefined suppress" option.
  Added checks for gamma and chromaticity values over 21474.83, which exceed
    the limit for PNG unsigned 32-bit integers when encoded.
  Revised calls to png_create_read_struct() and png_create_write_struct()
    for simpler debugging.
  Revised png_zalloc() so zlib handles errors (uses PNG_FLAG_MALLOC_NULL_MEM_OK)
version 1.2.2beta2 [February 24, 2002]
  Check chunk_length and idat_size for invalid (over PNG_MAX_UINT) lengths.
  Check for invalid image dimensions in png_get_IHDR.
  Added missing "fi;" in the install target of the SGI makefiles.
  Added install-static to all makefiles that make shared libraries.
  Always do gamma compensation when image is partially transparent.
