Changes since the last public release (1.6.9):

Version 1.6.10beta01 [February 9, 2014]
  Backported changes from libpng-1.7.0beta30 and beta31:
  Fixed a large number of instances where PNGCBAPI was omitted from
    function definitions.
  Added pngimage test program for png_read_png() and png_write_png()
    with two new test scripts.
  Removed dependence on !PNG_READ_EXPAND_SUPPORTED for calling
    png_set_packing() in png_read_png().
  Fixed combination of ~alpha with shift. On read invert alpha, processing
    occurred after shift processing, which causes the final values to be
    outside the range that should be produced by the shift. Reversing the
    order on read makes the two transforms work together correctly and mirrors
    the order used on write.
  Do not read invalid sBIT chunks. Previously libpng only checked sBIT
    values on write, so a malicious PNG writer could therefore cause
    the read code to return an invalid sBIT chunk, which might lead to
    application errors or crashes.  Such chunks are now skipped (with
    chunk_benign_error).
  Make png_read_png() and png_write_png() prototypes in png.h depend
    upon PNG_READ_SUPPORTED and PNG_WRITE_SUPPORTED.
  Support builds with unsupported PNG_TRANSFORM_* values.  All of the
    PNG_TRANSFORM_* values are always defined in png.h and, because they
    are used for both read and write in some cases, it is not reliable
    to #if out ones that are totally unsupported. This change adds error
    detection in png_read_image() and png_write_image() to do a
    png_app_error() if the app requests something that cannot be done
    and it adds corresponding code to pngimage.c to handle such options
    by not attempting to test them.
