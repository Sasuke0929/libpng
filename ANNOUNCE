Changes since the last public release (1.6.13):

Version 1.6.14beta01 [September 14, 2014]
  Guard usage of png_ptr->options with #ifdef PNG_SET_OPTION_SUPPORTED.
  Do not build contrib/tools/pngfix.c when PNG_SETJMP_NOT_SUPPORTED,
    to allow "make" to complete without setjmp support (bug report by
    Claudio Fontana)
  Add "#include <setjmp.h>" to contrib/tools/pngfix.c (John Bowler)

Version 1.6.14beta02 [September 18, 2014]
  Use nanosleep() instead of usleep() in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c
    because usleep() is deprecated.
  Define usleep() in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c if not already defined
    in unistd.h and nanosleep() is not available; fixes error introduced
    in libpng-1.6.13.
  Disable floating point exception handling in pngvalid.c when
    PNG_FLOATING_ARITHMETIC is not supported (bug report by "zootus
    at users.sourceforge.net").

Version 1.6.14beta03 [September 19, 2014]
  Define FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INVALID, and FE_OVERFLOW in pngvalid.c if not
    already defined.  Revert floating point exception handling in pngvalid.c
    to version 1.6.14beta01 behavior.

Version 1.6.14beta04 [September 27, 2014]
  Fixed incorrect handling of the iTXt compression flag in pngrutil.c
    (bug report by Shunsaku Hirata).  Bug was introduced in libpng-1.6.0.

Version 1.6.14beta05 [September 27, 2014]
