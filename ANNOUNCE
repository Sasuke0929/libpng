Changes since the last public release:

libpng-1.0.2a:

  Replaced and extended code that was removed from png_set_filler() in 1.0.1a.
  Fixed a bug in png_do_filler() that made it fail to write filler bytes in
    the left-most pixel of each row (Kevin Bracey).
  Changed "static pngcharp tIME_string" to "static char tIME_string[30]"
    in pngtest.c (Duncan Simpson).
  Fixed a problem in pngrutil.c: gray_to_rgb didn't always work with 16-bit.
  Fixed a problem in png_read_push_finish_row(), which would not skip some
    passes that it should skip, for images that are less than 3 pixels high.
  Interchanged the order of calls to png_do_swap() and png_do_shift()
    in pngwtran.c (John Cromer).
  Added #ifdef PNG_DEBUG/#endif surrounding use of PNG_DEBUG in png.h .
  Changed "bad adaptive filter type" from error to warning in pngrutil.c .
  Fixed a documentation error about default filtering with 8-bit indexed-color.
  Separated the PNG_NO_STDIO macro into PNG_NO_STDIO and PNG_NO_CONSOLE_IO
    (L. Peter Deutsch).
  Added png_set_rgb_to_gray() and png_get_rgb_to_gray_status() functions.
  Added png_get_copyright() and png_get_header_version() functions.
  Revised comments on png_set_progressive_read_fn() in libpng.txt and example.c
  Added information about debugging in libpng.txt and libpng.3 .
  Changed "ln -sf" to "ln -s -f" in makefile.s2x, makefile.lnx, and makefile.sco.
  Removed lines after Dynamic Dependencies" in makefile.aco .
  Revised makefile.dec to make a shared library (Jeremie Petit).
