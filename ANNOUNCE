Libpng 1.0.1b May 2, 1998

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release:

libpng-1.0.1a:
  Optimized Paeth calculations by replacing abs() function calls with intrinsics
  plus other loop optimizations. Improves avg decoding speed by about 20 percent.
  Commented out i386istic "align" compiler flags in makefile.lnx.
  Reduced the default warning level in some makefiles, to make them consistent.
  Removed references to IJG and JPEG in the ansi2knr.c copyright statement.
  Fixed a bug in png_do_strip_filler with XXRRGGBB => RRGGBB transformation.
  Added grayscale and 16-bit capability to png_do_read_filler().
  Fixed a bug in pngset.c, introduced in version 0.99c, that sets rowbytes
    too large when writing an image with bit_depth < 8 (Bob Dellaca).
  Corrected some bugs in the experimental weighted filtering heuristics.
  Moved a misplaced pngrutil code block that truncates tRNS if it has more
    than num_palette entries -- test was done before num_palette was defined.
  Fixed a png_convert_to_rfc1123() bug that converts day 31 to 0 (Steve Eddins).
libpng-1.0.1b:
  Relocated png_do_gray_to_rgb() within png_do_read_transformations() (Greg).
  Relocated the png_composite macros from pngrtran.c to png.h (Greg).
  Added makefile.sco (contributed by Mike Hopkirk).
  Fixed two bugs (missing definitions of "istop") introduced in libpng-1.0.1a.
  Fixed a bug in pngrtran.c that would set channels=5 under some circumstances.
  More work on the Paeth-filtering, achieving imperceptible speedup (A Kleinert).
  More work on loop optimization which may help when compiled with C++ compilers.
  Added warnings when people try to use transforms they've defined out.
