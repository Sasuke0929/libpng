Changes since the last public release (1.5.4):

Version 1.5.5beta01 [July 13, 2011]
  Fixed some typos and made other minor changes in the manual.
  Updated contrib/pngminus/makefile.std (Samuli Souminen)

Version 1.5.5beta02 [July 14, 2011]
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to look in the right directory for
    pnglibconf.h.prebuilt

Version 1.5.5beta03 [July 27, 2011]
  Enabled compilation with g++ compiler.  This compiler does not recognize
    the file extension, so it always compiles with C++ rules.  Made minor
    changes to pngrutil.c to cast results where C++ expects it but C does not.
  Minor editing of libpng.3 and libpng-manual.txt.

Version 1.5.5beta04 [July 29, 2011]
  Revised CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)
  Updated commentary about the png_rgb_to_gray() default coefficients
    in the manual and in pngrtran.c

Version 1.5.5beta05 [August 17, 2011]
  Prevent unexpected API exports from non-libpng DLLs on Windows.  The "_DLL"
    is removed from the test of whether a DLL is being built (this erroneously
    caused the libpng APIs to be marked as DLL exports in static builds under
    Microsoft Visual Studio).  Almost all of the libpng building configuration
    is moved from pngconf.h to pngpriv.h, but PNG_DLL_EXPORT remains in
    pngconf.h, though, so that it is colocated with the import definition (it
    is no longer used anywhere in the installed headers).  The VStudio project
    definitions have been cleaned up: "_USRDLL" has been removed from the
    static library builds (this was incorrect), and PNG_USE_DLL has been added
    to pngvalid to test the functionality (pngtest does not supply it,
    deliberately).  The spurious "_EXPORTS" has been removed from the
    libpng build (all these errors were a result of copy/paste between project
    configurations.)
  Added new types and internal functions for CIE RGB end point handling to
    pngpriv.h (functions yet to be implemented).
