Changes since the last public release (1.2.36):

version 1.2.37beta01 [May 14, 2009]
  Fixed inconsistency in pngrutil.c, introduced in libpng-1.2.36.  The
    memset() was using "png_ptr->rowbytes" instead of "row_bytes", which
    the corresponding png_malloc() uses (Joe Drew).
  Clarified usage of sig_bit versus sig_bit_p in example.c (Vincent Torri)
  Updated some of the makefiles in the scripts directory (merged with
    those in libpng-1.4.0beta57).

version 1.2.37beta02 [May 19, 2009]
  Fixed typo in libpng documentation (FILTER_AVE should be FILTER_AVG)
  Relocated misplaced #endif in pngwrite.c, sCAL chunk handler.
  Conditionally compile png_read_finish_row() which is not used by
    progressive readers.
  Added contrib/pngminim/preader to demonstrate building minimal progressive
    decoder, based on contrib/gregbook with embedded libpng and zlib.

version 1.2.37beta03 [May 20, 2009]
  In contrib/pngminim/*, renamed "makefile.std" to "makefile", since there
    is only one makefile in those directories, and revised the README files
    accordingly.
  Reformated sources in libpng style (3-space indentation, comment format)

version 1.2.37rc01 [May 27, 2009]
  No changes.
