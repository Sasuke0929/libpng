Changes since the last public release (1.6.0):

Version 1.6.1beta01 [February 16, 2013]
  Made symbol prefixing work with the ARM neon optimizations. Also allow
    pngpriv.h to be included for preprocessor definitions only, so it can
    be used in non-C/C++ files. Back ported from libpng 1.7.
  Made sRGB check numbers consistent.
  Ported libpng 1.5 options.awk/dfn file handling to 1.6, fixed one bug.
  Removed cc -E workround, corrected png_get_palette_max API Tested on
    SUN OS cc 5.9, which demonstrates the tokenization problem previously
    avoided by using /lib/cpp.  Since all .dfn output is now protected in
    double quotes unless it is to be macro substituted the fix should
    work everywhere.
  Enabled parallel tests - back ported from libpng-1.7.
  scripts/pnglibconf.dfa formatting improvements back ported from libpng17.
  Fixed a race condition in the creation of the build 'scripts' directory
    while building with a parallel make.
  Use approved/supported Android method to check for NEON, use Linux/POSIX
    1003.1 API to check /proc/self/auxv avoiding buffer allocation and other
    library calls (ported from libpng15).
