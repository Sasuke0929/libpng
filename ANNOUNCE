Libpng 1.0.4c - October 1, 1999

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.3):

version 1.0.3a [August 12, 1999]
  Added check for PNG_READ_INTERLACE_SUPPORTED in pngread.c; issue a warning
     if an attempt is made to read an interlaced image when it's not supported.
  Added check if png_ptr->trans is defined before free'ing it in pngread.c
  Modified the Y2K statement to include versions back to version 0.71
  Fixed a bug in the check for valid IHDR bit_depth/color_types in pngrutil.c
  Modified makefile.wat (added -zp8 flag, ".symbolic", changed some comments)
  Replaced leading blanks with tab characters in makefile.hux
  Changed "dworkin.wustl.edu" to "ccrc.wustl.edu" in various documents.
  Changed (float)red and (float)green to (double)red, (double)green
     in png_set_rgb_to_gray() to avoid "promotion" problems in AIX.
  Fixed a bug in pngconf.h that omitted <stdio.h> when PNG_DEBUG==0 (K Bracey).
  Reformatted libpng.3 and libpngpf.3 with proper fonts (script by J. vanZandt).
  Updated documentation to refer to the PNG-1.2 specification.
  Removed ansi2knr.c and left pointers to the latest source for ansi2knr.c
    in makefile.knr, INSTALL, and README (L. Peter Deutsch)
  Fixed bugs in calculation of the length of rowbytes when adding alpha
    channels to 16-bit images, in pngrtran.c (Chris Nokleberg)
  Added function png_set_user_transform_info() to store user_transform_ptr,
    user_depth, and user_channels into the png_struct, and a function
    png_get_user_transform_ptr() to retrieve the pointer (Chris Nokleberg)
  Added function png_set_empty_plte_permitted() to make libpng useable
    in MNG applications.
  Corrected the typedef for png_free_ptr in png.h (Jesse Jones).
  Correct gamma with srgb is 45455 instead of 45000 in pngrutil.c, to be
    consistent with PNG-1.2, and allow variance of 500 before complaining.
  Added assembler code contributed by Intel in file pngvcrd.c and modified
    makefile.w32 to use it (Nirav Chhatrapati, INTEL Corporation, Gilles Vollant)
  Changed "ln -s -f" to "ln -f -s" in the makefiles to make Solaris happy.
  Added some aliases for png_set_expand() in pngrtran.c, namely
    png_set_expand_PLTE(), png_set_expand_depth(), and png_set_expand_tRNS()
    (Greg Roelofs, in "PNG: The Definitive Guide").
  Added makefile.beo for BEOS on X86, contributed by Sander Stok.
version 1.0.3b [August 26, 1999]
  Replaced 2147483647L several places with PNG_MAX_UINT macro, defined in png.h
  Changed leading blanks to tabs in all makefiles.
  Define PNG_USE_PNGVCRD in makefile.w32, to get MMX assembler code.
  Made alternate versions of  png_set_expand() in pngrtran.c, namely
    png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8, png_set_palette_to_rgb, and png_set_tRNS_to_alpha
    (Greg Roelofs, in "PNG: The Definitive Guide").  Deleted the 1.0.3a aliases.
  Relocated start of 'extern "C"' block in png.h so it doesn't include pngconf.h
  Revised calculation of num_blocks in pngmem.c to avoid a potentially
    negative shift distance, whose results are undefined in the C language.
  Added a check in pngset.c to prevent writing multiple tIME chunks.
  Added a check in pngwrite.c to detect invalid small window_bits sizes.
version 1.0.3d [September 4, 1999]
  Fixed type casting of igamma in pngrutil.c
  Added new png_expand functions to scripts/pngdef.pas and pngos2.def
  Added a demo read_user_transform_fn that examines the row filters in pngtest.c
version 1.0.4 [September 24, 1999]
  Define PNG_ALWAYS_EXTERN in pngconf.h if __STDC__ is defined
  Delete #define PNG_INTERNAL and include "png.h" from pngasmrd.h
  Made several minor corrections to pngtest.c
  Changed "hptr += 16L" to "hptr = hptr + 16L" in pngmem.c for Turbo 3.0
  Renamed the makefiles with longer but more user friendly extensions.
  Copied the PNG copyright and license to a separate LICENSE file.
  Revised documentation, png.h, and example.c to remove reference to
    "viewing_gamma" which no longer appears in the PNG specification.
  Revised pngvcrd.c to use MMX code for interlacing only on the final pass.
  Updated pngvcrd.c to use the faster C filter algorithms from libpng-1.0.1a
  Split makefile.win32vc into two versions, makefile.vcawin32 (uses MMX
    assembler code) and makefile.vcwin32 (doesn't).
  Added a CPU timing report to pngtest.c (enabled by defining PNGTEST_TIMING)
version 1.0.4a September 25, 1999
  Increase max_pixel_depth in pngrutil.c if a user transform needs it.
  Changed several division operations to right-shifts in pngvcrd.c
version 1.0.4b September 30, 1999
  Added parentheses in line 3732 of pngvcrd.c
  Added a comment in makefile.linux warning about buggy -O3 in pgcc 2.95.1
version 1.0.4c [October 1, 1999]
  Added a "png_check_version" function in png.c and pngtest.c that will generate
    a helpful compiler error if an old png.h is found in the search path.
