Libpng 1.2.0beta3 - May 18, 2001

This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.11):

  Test for Windows platform in pngconf.h when including malloc.h (Emmanuel Blot)
  Updated makefile.cygwin and handling of Cygwin's ALL_STATIC in pngconf.h
  Added some never-to-be-executed code in pnggccrd.c to quiet compiler warnings.
  Enabled PNG_MNG_FEATURES_SUPPORTED and enabled PNG_ASSEMBLER_CODE_SUPPORTED
    by default.
  Added runtime selection of MMX features.
  Added png_set_strip_error_numbers function and related macros.
  Added a check for attempts to read or write PLTE in grayscale PNG datastreams.
  Eliminated the png_error about apps using png_read|write_init().  Instead,
    libpng will reallocate the png_struct and info_struct if they are too small.
    This retains future binary compatibility for old applications written for
    libpng-0.88 and earlier.
  Enabled user memory function by default.
  Modified png_create_struct so it passes user mem_ptr to user memory allocator.
  Increased png_mng_features flag from png_byte to png_uint_32.
  Bumped shared-library (so-number) and dll-number to 3.
