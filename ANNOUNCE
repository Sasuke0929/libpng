Changes since the last public release (1.6.7):

Version 1.6.8beta01 [November 22, 2013]
  Changed #ifdef PNG_HANDLE_AS_UNKNOWN_SUPPORTED in pngpread.c to
    #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED to be consistent with
    what is in pngpriv.h.
  Moved prototype for png_handle_unknown() in pngpriv.h outside of
    the #ifdef PNG_SET_UNKNOWN_CHUNKS_SUPPORTED/#endif block.
  Added "-Wall" to CFLAGS in contrib/pngminim/*/makefile
  Conditionally compile some unused functions reported by -Wall in pngminim.
  Fixed 'minimal' builds. Various obviously useful minimal configurations
    don't build because of missing contrib/libtests test programs and overly
    complex dependencies in scripts/pnglibconf.dfa. This change adds
    contrib/conftest/*.dfa files that can be used in automatic build
    scripts to ensure that these configurations continue to build.
