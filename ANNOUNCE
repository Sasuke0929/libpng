Changes since the last public release (1.2.34):


version 1.2.35beta01 [February 4, 2009]
  Zero out some arrays of pointers after png_malloc(). (Tavis Ormandy)

version 1.2.35beta02 [Feburary 4, 2009]
  Zero out more arrays of pointers after png_malloc().

version 1.2.35beta03 [February 6, 2009]
  Use png_memset() instead of a loop to intialize pointers.  We realize
    this will not work on platforms where the NULL pointer is not all zeroes.
