Changes since the last public release (1.4.5):

  Fixed bug in background transformation handling in pngrtran.c (it was
    looking for the flag in png_ptr->transformations instead of in
    png_ptr->flags) (David Raymond).
  Fixed misspelled macros in contrib/pngminim (Cosmin)
  Updated CMakeLists.txt (Clifford Yapp)
  Fixed some typecasts in png_debug statements (Cosmin).
  Updated documentation of png_set|get_tRNS() (Thomas Klausner).
  Added png_const_structp and png_const_infop types, and used them in
    prototypes for most png_get_*() functions.
  In the manual, describe the png_get_IHDR() arguments in the correct order.
  Updated the synopses in the manual to reflect recent changes.
  Fixed a typo in the *.def files and deleted entries that are now
    declared in pngpriv.h
  Updated contrib/pngsuite/README to add the word "modify".
  Added the private PNG_UNUSED() macro definition in pngconf.h.
  ifdef out mask arrays in pngread.c when interlacing is not supported.
  Added attribute definition (warnings) for MSC_VER >= 1300 in pngconf.h
  Added -D_CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE to CFLAGS in makefile.vcwin32
  Fixed mistake in the descriptions of user read_transform and write_transform
    function prototypes in the manual.  The row_info struct is png_row_infop.
  Added a request in the manual that applications do not use "png_" or
    "PNG_" to begin any of their own symbols.
  Fixed incorrect examples of callback prototypes in the manual, that were
    introduced in libpng-1.0.0.
  Removed "strip" from contrib/pngminim/*/makefile.
  Fixed a bug (present since libpng-1.0.7) that makes png_handle_sPLT() fail
    to compile when PNG_NO_POINTER_INDEXING is defined (Chubanov Kirill)
  Improved the optimization of the zlib CMF byte (see libpng-1.2.6beta03).
