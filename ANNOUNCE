Changes since the last public release (1.5.2):

Version 1.5.3beta01 [April 1, 2011]
  Re-initialize the zlib compressor before compressing non-IDAT chunks.
  Added API functions to set parameters for zlib compression of non-IDAT
    chunks.

Version 1.5.3beta02 [April 3, 2011]
  Updated scripts/symbols.def with new API functions.
  Only compile the new zlib re-initializing code when text or iCCP is
    supported, using PNG_WRITE_COMPRESSED_TEXT_SUPPORTED macro.
  Improved the optimization of the zlib CMF byte (see libpng-1.2.6beta03).
  Optimize the zlib CMF byte in non-IDAT compressed chunks

Version 1.5.3beta03 [April 16, 2011]
  Fixed gcc -ansi -pedantic compile. A strict ANSI system does not have
    snprintf, and the "__STRICT_ANSI__" detects that condition more reliably
    than __STDC__ (John Bowler).
  Removed the PNG_PTR_NORETURN attribute because it too dangerous. It tells
    the compiler that a user supplied callback (the error handler) does not
    return, yet there is no guarantee in practice that the application code
    will correctly implement the error handler because the compiler only
    issues a warning if there is a mistake (John Bowler).
  Removed the no-longer-used PNG_DEPSTRUCT macro.
  Updated the zlib version to 1.2.5 in the VStudio project.
  Fixed 64-bit builds where png_uint_32 is smaller than png_size_t in
    pngwutil.c (John Bowler).
  Fixed bug with stripping the filler or alpha channel when writing, that
    was introduced in libpng-1.5.2beta01.

Version 1.5.3beta04 [April 17, 2011]
