Changes since the last public release (1.4.1):

version 1.4.2beta01 [April 1, 2010]
  Restored the macro definition of png_check_sig().
  Conditionally compile an "else" statement in png_decompress_chunk().

version 1.4.2rc01 [April 10, 2010]
  No changes.

version 1.4.2rc02 [April 16, 2010]
  Documented the fact that png_set_dither() was disabled since libpng-1.4.0.
  Reenabled png_set_dither() but renamed it to png_set_quantize() to reflect
    more accurately what it actually does.  At the same time, renamed
    the PNG_DITHER_[RED,GREEN_BLUE]_BITS macros to
    PNG_QUANTIZE_[RED,GREEN,BLUE]_BITS.

version 1.4.2rc03 [April 16, 2010]
  Added some "(long)" typecasts to printf calls in png_handle_cHRM().
