Changes since the last public release (1.6.2):

Version 1.6.3beta01 [April 25, 2013]
  Revised stack marking in arm/filter_neon.S and configure.ac.
  Ensure that NEON filter stuff is completely disabled when switched 'off'.
    Previously the ARM NEON specific files were still built if the option
    was switched 'off' as opposed to being explicitly disabled.

Version 1.6.3beta02 [April 26, 2013]
  Test for 'arm*' not just 'arm' in the host_cpu configure variable.
  Rebuilt the configure scripts.
