Changes since the last public release (1.6.13):

Version 1.6.13beta01 [July 4, 2014]
  Quieted -Wsign-compare and -Wclobber compiler warnings in
    contrib/pngminus/*.c
  Added "(void) png_ptr;" where needed in contrib/gregbook to quiet
    compiler complaints about unused pointers.
  Split a long output string in contrib/gregbook/rpng2-x.c.
  Added "PNG_SET_OPTION" requirement for sRGB chunk support to pnglibconf.dfa,
    Needed for write-only support (John Bowler).
  Changed "if defined(__ARM_NEON__)" to
    "if (defined(__ARM_NEON__) || defined(__ARM_NEON))" (James Wu).
  Fixed clang no-warning builds: png_digit was defined but never used.
    
Version 1.6.13beta02 [July 21, 2014]
  Fixed an incorrect separator ("/" should be "\") in scripts/makefile.vcwin32
    (bug report from Wolfgang S. Kechel).  Bug was introduced in libpng-1.6.11.
    Also fixed makefile.bc32, makefile.bor, makefile.msc, makefile.intel, and
    makefile.tc3 similarly.
