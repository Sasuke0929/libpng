Changes since the last public release (1.6.10):

Version 1.6.11beta01 [March 17, 2014]
  Use "if (value != 0)" instead of "if (value)" consistently.
  Changed ZlibSrcDir from 1.2.5 to 1.2.8 in projects/vstudio.
  Moved configuration information from the manual to the INSTALL file.

Version 1.6.11beta02 [March 25, 2014]
  Removed #if/#else/#endif from inside two pow() calls in pngvalid.c because
    they were handled improperly by Portland Group's PGI-14.1 - PGI-14.3
    when using its "__builtin_pow()" function.
  Silence 'unused parameter' build warnings (Cosmin).
  $(CP) is now used alongside $(RM_F).  Also, use 'copy' instead
    of 'cp' where applicable, and applied other minor makefile changes.
  Don't warn about invalid dimensions exceeding user limits.
  Allow an easy replacement of the default pre-built configuration
    header with a custom header, via the make PNGLIBCONF_H_PREBUILT
    macro.
