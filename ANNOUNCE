Changes since the last public release (1.6.17):

Version 1.6.18beta01 [April 01, 2015]
  Removed PNG_SET_CHUNK_[CACHE|MALLOC]_LIMIT_SUPPORTED macros.  They
    have been combined with PNG_SET_USER_LIMITS_SUPPORTED (resolves
    bug report by Andrew Church).
  Fixed rgb_to_gray checks and added tRNS checks to pngvalid.c.  This
    fixes some arithmetic errors that caused some tests to fail on
    some 32-bit platforms (Bug reports by Peter Breitenlohner [i686]
    and Petr Gajdos [i586]).

Version 1.6.18beta02 [April 1, 2015]
  Suppressed some warnings from the Borland C++ 5.5.1/5.82 compiler
    (Bug report by Viktor Szaka'ts).
