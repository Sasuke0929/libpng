Changes since the last public release (1.6.1):

Version 1.6.2beta01 [April 14, 2013]
  Updated documentation of 1.5.x to 1.6.x changes in iCCP chunk handling.
  Fixed incorrect warning of excess deflate data. End condition - the
    warning would be produced if the end of the deflate stream wasn't read
    in the last row.  The warning is harmless.
  Corrected the test on user transform changes on read. It was in the
    png_set of the transform function, but that doesn't matter unless the
    transform function changes the rowbuf size, and that is only valid if
    transform_info is called.
  Corrected a misplaced closing bracket in contrib/libtests/pngvalid.c
    (Flavio Medeiros).
  Corrected length written to uncompressed iTXt chunks (Samuli Suominen).

Version 1.6.2rc01 [April 18, 2013]
  Added contrib/tools/fixitxt.c, to repair the erroneous iTXt chunk length
    written by libpng-1.6.0 and 1.6.1.
    Levchenko).
  Disallow storing sRGB information when the sRGB is not supported.

Version 1.6.2rc02 [April 18, 2013]
  Merge pngtest.c with libpng-1.7.0

Version 1.6.2rc03 [April 22, 2013]
  Trivial spelling cleanup.

Version 1.6.2rc04 [April 22, 2013]
  Revised stack marking in arm/filter_neon.S and configure.ac

Version 1.6.2rc05 [April 23, 2013]
  Ensure that NEON filter stuff is completely disabled when switched 'off'.
    Previously the ARM NEON specific files were still built if the option
    was switched 'off' as opposed to being explicitly disabled.
