Changes since the last public release (1.6.8):

Version 1.6.9beta01 [December 26, 2013]
  Bookkeeping: Moved functions around (no changes). Moved transform
    function definitions before the place where they are called so that
    they can be masde static. Move the intrapixel functions and the
    grayscale palette builder out of the png?tran.c files. The latter
    isn't a transform function and is no longer used internally, and the
    former MNG specific functions are better placed in pngread/pngwrite.c
  Made transform implementation functions static. This makes the internal
    functions called by png_do_{read|write}_transformations static. On an
    x86-64 DLL build (Gentoo Linux) this reduces the size of the text
    segment of the DLL by 1208 bytes, about 0.6%. It also simplifies
    maintenance by removing the declarations from pngpriv.h and allowing
    easier changes to the internal interfaces.
  Rebuilt configure scripts with automake-1.14.1 and autoconf-2.59(2013)
    in the tar distributions.
