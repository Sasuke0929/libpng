Libpng 1.0.5a - October 23, 1999

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.5):

version 1.0.5a [October 23, 1999]
  Added contrib/pngsuite and contrib/pngminus (Willem van Schaik)
  Fixed a typo in the png_set_sRGB() function call in example.c (Jan Nijtmans)
  Further optimization and bugfix of pngvcrd.c
  Revised pngset.c so that it does not allocate or free memory in the user's
    text_ptr structure.  Instead, it makes its own copy.
  Created separate write_end_info_struct in pngtest.c for a more severe test.
  Added code in pngwrite.c to free info_ptr->text[i].key to stop a memory leak.
