Changes since the last public release (1.4.0):

version 1.4.1beta01 [January 8, 2010]
  Updated CMakeLists.txt for consistent indentation and to avoid an
    unclosed if-statement warning (Philip Lowman).
  Revised Makefile.am and Makefile.in to remove references to Y2KINFO,
    KNOWNBUG, and libpng.la (Robert Schwebel).
  Revised the makefiles to install the same files and symbolic
    links as configure, except for libpng.la and libpng14.la.
  Make png_set|get_compression_buffer_size() available even when
    PNG_WRITE_SUPPORTED is not enabled.
