Changes since the last public release (1.6.25):

Version 1.6.26beta01 [September 19, 2016]
  Fixed handling zero length IDAT in pngfix (bug report by Agostino Sarubbo,
    bugfix by John Bowler).
  Do not issue a png_error() on read in png_set_pCAL() because png_handle_pCAL
    has allocated memory that libpng needs to free.
  Conditionally compile png_set_benign_errors() in pngread.c and pngtest.c
  Issue a png_benign_error instead of a png_error on ADLER32 mismatch
    while decoding compressed data chunks.
  Changed PNG_ZLIB_VERNUM to ZLIB_VERNUM in pngpriv.h, pngstruct.h, and
    pngrutil.c.
