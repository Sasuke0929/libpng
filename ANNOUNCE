Changes since the last public release (1.6.10):

  Use "if (value != 0)" instead of "if (value)" consistently.
  Changed ZlibSrcDir from 1.2.5 to 1.2.8 in projects/vstudio.
  Moved configuration information from the manual to the INSTALL file.
  Removed #if/#else/#endif from inside two pow() calls in pngvalid.c because
    they were handled improperly by Portland Group's PGI-14.1 - PGI-14.3
    when using its "__builtin_pow()" function.
  Silence 'unused parameter' build warnings (Cosmin Truta).
  $(CP) is now used alongside $(RM_F).  Also, use 'copy' instead of 'cp'
    where applicable, and applied other minor makefile changes (Cosmin).
  Don't warn about invalid dimensions exceeding user limits (Cosmin).
  Allow an easy replacement of the default pre-built configuration
    header with a custom header, via the make PNGLIBCONF_H_PREBUILT
    macro (Cosmin).
  Fixed a typo in pngrutil.c, introduced in libpng-1.5.6, that interferes
    with "blocky" expansion of sub-8-bit interlaced PNG files (Eric Huss).
  Made progressive reading of interlaced images consistent with the
    behavior of the sequential reader and consistent with the manual, by
    moving some code out of the PNG_READ_INTERLACING_SUPPORTED blocks. The
    row_callback now receives the proper pass number and unexpanded rows, when
    png_combine_row() isn't built or used, and png_set_interlace_handling()
    is not called.
  Allow PNG_sRGB_PROFILE_CHECKING = (-1) to mean no sRGB profile checking.
  Do not reject ICC V2 profiles that lack padding (Kai-Uwe Behrmann).
  Relocated closing bracket of the sRGB profile test loop to avoid getting
    "Not recognizing known sRGB profile that has been edited" warning for
    ICC V2 profiles that lack the MD5 signature in the profile header.
  Added PNG_SKIP_sRGB_CHECK_PROFILE choice for png_set_option().
  Test ZLIB_VERNUM instead of PNG_ZLIB_VERNUM in contrib/tools/pngfix.c
