Libpng 1.0.6i - May 1, 2000

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.6):

version 1.0.6d [April 8, 2000]
  Changed sprintf() to strcpy() in png_write_sCAL_s() to work without STDIO
  Added data_length parameter to png_decompress_chunk() function
  Revised documentation to remove reference to abandoned png_free_chnk functions
  Fixed an error in png_rgb_to_gray_fixed()
  Revised example.c, usage of png_destroy_write_struct().
  Renamed makefile.ibmvac3 to makefile.ibmc, added libpng.icc IBM project file
  Added a check for info_ptr->free_me&PNG_FREE_TEXT when free'ing text in png.c
  Simplify png_sig_bytes() function to remove use of non-ISO-C strdup().
version 1.0.6e [April 9, 2000]
  Added png_data_freer() function.
  In the code that checks for over-length tRNS chunks, added check of
    info_ptr->num_trans as well as png_ptr->num_trans (Matthias Benckmann)
  Minor revisions of libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Check for existing data and free it if the free_me flag is set, in png_set_*()
    and png_handle_*().
  Only define PNG_WEIGHTED_FILTERS_SUPPORTED when PNG_FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORTED
    is defined.
  Changed several instances of PNG_NO_CONSOLE_ID to PNG_NO_STDIO in pngrutil.c
    and mentioned the purposes of the two macros in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
version 1.0.6f [April 14, 2000]
  Revised png_set_iCCP() and png_set_rows() to avoid prematurely freeing data.
  Add checks in png_set_text() for NULL members of the input text structure.
  Revised libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Removed superfluous prototype for png_set_itxt from png.h
  Removed "else" from pngread.c, after png_error(), and changed "0" to "length".
  Changed several png_errors about malformed ancillary chunks to png_warnings.
version 1.0.6g [April 24, 2000]
  Added png_pass-* arrays to pnggccrd.c when PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Relocated paragraph about png_set_background() in libpng.3/libpng.txt
    and other revisions (Matthias Benckmann)
  Relocated info_ptr->free_me, png_ptr->free_me, and other info_ptr and
    png_ptr members to restore binary compatibility with libpng-1.0.5
    (breaks compatibility with libpng-1.0.6).
version 1.0.6h [April 24, 2000]
  Changed shared library so-number pattern from 2.x.y.z to xy.z (this builds
    libpng.so.10 & libpng.so.10.6h instead of libpng.so.2 & libpng.so.2.1.0.6h)
version 1.0.6i [May 1, 2000]
  Added documentation of user memory functions in libpng.txt/libpng.3
  Modified png_read_png so that it will use user_allocated row_pointers
    if present, unless free_me directs that it be freed, and added description
    of the use of png_set_rows() and png_get_rows() in libpng.txt/libpng.3.
  Added PNG_LEGACY_SUPPORTED macro, and #ifdef out all new (since version
    1.00) members of png_struct and png_info, to regain binary compatibility
    when you define this macro.  Capabilities lost in this event
    are user transforms (new in version 1.0.0),the user transform pointer
    (new in version 1.0.2), rgb_to_gray (new in 1.0.5), iCCP, sCAL, sPLT,
    the high-level interface, and unknown chunks support (all new in 1.0.6).
    This was necessary because of old applications that allocate the structs
    directly instead of using png_create_*(), as authors were instructed to
    do in libpng-0.88 and earlier.
  Added makefile.intel and updated makefile.watcom (Pawel Mrochen)
