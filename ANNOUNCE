Libpng 1.0.5d - November 29, 1999

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.0.5):

version libpng-1.0.5a October 23, 1999
  Added contrib/pngsuite and contrib/pngminus (Willem van Schaik)
  Fixed a typo in the png_set_sRGB() function call in example.c (Jan Nijtmans)
  Further optimization and bugfix of pngvcrd.c
  Revised pngset.c so that it does not allocate or free memory in the user's
    text_ptr structure.  Instead, it makes its own copy.
  Created separate write_end_info_struct in pngtest.c for a more severe test.
  Added code in pngwrite.c to free info_ptr->text[i].key to stop a memory leak.
version libpng-1.0.5b November 23, 1999
  Moved PNG_FLAG_HAVE_CHUNK_HEADER, PNG_FLAG_BACKGROUND_IS_GRAY and
    PNG_FLAG_WROTE_tIME from flags to mode.
  Added png_write_info_before_PLTE() function.
  Fixed some typecasting in contrib/gregbook/*.c
  Updated scripts/makevms.com and added makevms.com to contrib/gregbook
    and contrib/pngminus (Martin Zinser)
version libpng-1.0.5c November 26, 1999
  Moved png_get_header_version from png.h to png.c, to accomodate ansi2knr.
  Removed all global arrays (according to PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS macro), to
    accomodate making DLL's: Moved usr_png_ver from global variable to function
    png_get_header_ver() in png.c.  Moved png_sig to png_sig_bytes in png.c and
    eliminated use of png_sig in pngwutil.c.  Moved the various png_CHNK arrays
    into pngtypes.h.  Eliminated use of global png_pass arrays.  Declared the
    png_CHNK and png_pass arrays to be "const".  Made the global arrays
    available to applications (although none are used in libpng itself) when
    PNG_NO_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is not defined or when PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Removed some extraneous "-I" from contrib/pngminus/makefile.std
  Changed the PNG_sRGB_INTENT macros in png.h to be consistent with PNG-1.2.
  Change PNG_SRGB_INTENT to PNG_sRGB_INTENT in libpng.txt and libpng.3 
version 1.0.5d [November 29, 1999]
  Add type cast (png_const_charp) two places in png.c
  Eliminated pngtypes.h; use macros instead to declare PNG_CHNK arrays.
  Renamed "PNG_GLOBAL_ARRAYS" to "PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS" and made available
    to applications a macro "PNG_USE_LOCAL_ARRAYS".
  #ifdef out all the new declarations when PNG_USE_GLOBAL_ARRAYS is defined.
  Added PNG_EXPORT_VAR macro to accommodate making DLL's.
