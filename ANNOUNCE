Changes since the last public release (1.6.18):

Version 1.6.19beta01 [July 29, 2015]

  Updated obsolete information about the simplified API macros in the
    manual pages (Bug report by Arc Riley).
  Avoid potentially dereferencing NULL info_ptr in png_info_init_3().
  Rearranged png.h to put the major sections in the same order as
    in libpng17.
  Eliminated unused PNG_COST_SHIFT, PNG_WEIGHT_SHIFT, PNG_COST_FACTOR, and
    PNG_WEIGHT_FACTOR macros.
  Suppressed some warnings from the Borland C++ 5.5.1/5.82 compiler
    (Bug report by Viktor Szaka'ts).  Several warnings remain and are
    unavoidable, where we test for overflow.
