Libpng 1.2.2beta6 - March 31, 2002

This is not intended to be a public release.  It will be replaced
within a few weeks by a public version or by another test version.

Changes since the last public release (1.2.1):

version 1.2.2beta1 [February 22, 2002]
  Fixed a bug with reading the length of iCCP profiles (Larry Reeves).
  Revised makefile.linux, makefile.gcmmx, and others to generate
    libpng.a, libpngNN.so (not libpng.so.3), and libpngNN/png.h
  Revised makefile.darwin to remove "-undefined suppress" option.
  Added checks for gamma and chromaticity values over 21474.83, which exceed
    the limit for PNG unsigned 32-bit integers when encoded.
  Revised calls to png_create_read_struct() and png_create_write_struct()
    for simpler debugging.
  Revised png_zalloc() so zlib handles errors (uses PNG_FLAG_MALLOC_NULL_MEM_OK)
version 1.2.2beta2 [February 23, 2002]
  Check chunk_length and idat_size for invalid (over PNG_MAX_UINT) lengths.
  Check for invalid image dimensions in png_get_IHDR.
  Added missing "fi;" in the install target of the SGI makefiles.
  Added install-static to all makefiles that make shared libraries.
  Always do gamma compensation when image is partially transparent.
version 1.2.2beta3 [March 7, 2002]
  Modified shared-library makefiles to install pkgconfig/libpngNN.pc.
  Export (with PNGAPI) png_zalloc, png_zfree, and png_handle_as_unknown
  Removed unused png_write_destroy_info prototype from png.h
  Eliminated incorrect use of width_mmx from pnggccrd.c in pixel_bytes == 8 case
  Added install-shared target to all makefiles that make shared libraries.
  Stopped a double free of palette, hist, and trans when not using free_me.
  Added makefile.32sunu for Sun Ultra 32 and makefile.64sunu for Sun Ultra 64.
version 1.2.2beta4 [March 8, 2002]
  Compute background.gray and background_1.gray even when color_type is RGB
    in case image gets reduced to gray later (Jason Summers).
  Relocated a misplaced /bin/rm in the "install-shared" makefile targets
  Added PNG_1_0_X macro which can be used to build a 1.0.x-compatible library.
version 1.2.2beta5 [March 26, 2002]
  Added missing PNGAPI to several function definitions.
  Check for invalid bit_depth or color_type in png_get_IHDR(), and
    check for missing PLTE or IHDR in png_push_read_chunk() (Matthias Clasen).
  Revised iTXt support to accept NULL for lang and lang_key.
  Compute gamma for color components of background even when color_type is gray.
  Changed "()" to "{}" in pkgconfig/libpngNN.pc.
  Revised makefiles to put png.h and pngconf.h only in $prefix/include/libpngNN
  Revised makefiles to make symlink to libpng.so.NN in addition to libpngNN.so
version 1.2.2beta6 [March 31, 2002]
  Prevent png_zalloc() from trying to memset memory that it failed to acquire.
  Add typecasts of PNG_MAX_UINT in pngset_cHRM_fixed() (Matt Holgate).
  Ensure that the right function (user or default) is used to free the
    png_struct after an error in png_create_read_struct_2().
